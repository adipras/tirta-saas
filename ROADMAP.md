## 💡 Development Principles

### DO (Focus Areas)
✅ **Complete core features** before adding new ones
✅ **Fix critical bugs** immediately
✅ **User experience** - make it intuitive
✅ **Performance** - fast loading, responsive
✅ **Reliability** - no data loss, proper validation
✅ **Mobile-first** for field operations
✅ **Notifications** - keep users informed

### DON'T (Avoid)
❌ Don't build Platform Owner fancy features yet
❌ Don't add "nice-to-have" features
❌ Don't over-engineer
❌ Don't ignore user feedback
❌ Don't skip testing
❌ Don't deploy without backup

---

## 📱 Platform Owner - MVP Scope

### What Platform Owner CAN Do (MVP):
1. ✅ View list of tenants
2. ✅ View tenant details (subscription info)
3. ✅ See basic metrics (tenant count, MRR)
4. ✅ Manage tenant status (active/suspended)
5. ⏸️ View simple analytics dashboard

### What Platform Owner CANNOT Do (Not MVP):
❌ Detailed revenue analytics
❌ Advanced charts & graphs
❌ Subscription plan UI management
❌ Billing & invoicing for subscriptions
❌ Usage-based pricing calculations
❌ Tenant performance comparisons
❌ White-label settings

**Why?** These features can wait until core water management is stable and proven.
